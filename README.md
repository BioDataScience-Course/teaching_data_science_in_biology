The courses in biostatistics in biology at the University of Mons, Belgium, were completely refactored in 2018 into data science courses (see http://bds.sciviews.org). The content is expanded beyond statistics to include computing tools, version management, reproducible analyses, critical thinking and open data. Flipped classroom approach is used. Students learn with the online material and they apply the concepts on individual and group projects using a preconfigured virtual machine with R and RStudio. Activities (H5P, learnr or Shiny applications) are recorded in a MongoDB database (300,000+ events for 180+ students and 2,000+ GitHub repositories at https://github.com/BioDataScience-Course). The analysis of these data reveals several trends. (1) There is a relatively long lag period required for the students to get used to the computing environment, the teaching method and the data science in general. (2) Implication is very high, with more than 85% of the students that complete all the activities and got good to excellent assessment. (3) There is a gap between students' own perception of their skills achievements and their assessment results: they tend to underestimate their progress. (4) During COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the intensity of the activities largely decreased during two weeks before returning to previous level, but for 3/4 of the students only. The remaining fraction never caught up. We hypothesize that the technical requirements or the lack of motivation during the lockdown were detrimental to roughly one student over ten, despite all the efforts the University deployed to reduce the social fracture.

The aim of this project is to answer the following questions :

- Are grades obtained by the students at a final exam correlated to their recorded activity during the course? If yes, (1) derive tools that predict student possible final results for early mitigation, and (2) investigate whether the grade from a final exam could be replaced by a grade calculated on student’s activities during the semesters. Ici, l’analyse ne peut bien sûr se faire que pour 2018-2019 et 2019-2020.

- Are there different student profiles that can be identified from their activities? If yes, how these profiles correlate with the metrics and with the performances?

- How do the student perceive the approach of the course and the tools used? In particular, what is the general emotional state of the students? What is the System Usability Scale of the software environment used in the course and why? What is the workload of the learnr tutorials (NASA-TLX) ? How is the timing of the course perceived?

- What is the temporal progression of the students in comparison with the proposed calendar, and is it somehow related to the student profile and/or their final grading?
