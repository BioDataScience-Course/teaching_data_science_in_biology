abstract = {The results of a multi-year research program to identify the factors associated with variations in subjective workload within and between different types of tasks are reviewed. Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload. {\textcopyright} 1988 Elsevier Science {\&} Technology.},

The researchers calculated an overall effect size of 0.566 from 70 studies, for a total of 219 effect-size measures from a sample of n = 40, 125 participants. These results suggest that the typical student moved from the 50th percentile to the 73rd percentile when technology was used as part of the curriculum. This study demonstrates that subcategories can further the understanding of how the use of CAI in statistics education might be maximized.

abstract = {Biostatistics is a critical skill to physicians in an evidence-based medicine era, but teaching basic statistical concepts is challenging. Students often experience anxiety caused by the complexity of statistics and might express negative attitudes toward the subject. We aimed to analyze the effect of an introductory biostatistics course using RStudio on attitude toward statistics and assess its acceptance among medical students. Forty-three 1st-year medical students were included. Pre- and post-course attitudes toward statistics were assessed using the Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS-28) scale and technology acceptance was assessed by a Technology Acceptance Model scale at the end of the course. There was a statistically discernible (significant) gain in the scores of three of the four SATS dimensions: affection (p = 0.006, Cohen's d = 0.442), cognitive competence (p {\textless} 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.605), and difficulty (p = 0.008, Cohen's d = 0.421). Acceptance of RStudio was moderate to high in 93{\%} of the participants, without statistical differences between genders. RStudio can be useful in the teaching of statistics to medical students, being well accepted and positively associated with students' attitude toward statistics.

abstract = {Many students who enroll in introductory statistics courses do not have positive attitudes about the subject. A 2012 wide-ranging study by Schau and Emmioglu showed that student attitudes do not tend to improve after completing an introductory statistics course. However, there is a need for more studies about attitudes in introductory statistics courses that utilize reform teaching methods. In this article, we present findings about student attitudes toward statistics in both a teacher-centered lecture-based class and a student-centered active learning class, taught by the same instructor. The overall results of this study were consistent with those reported in the study by Schau and Emmioğlu. Although on an overall level, it seemed that attitudes did not change for both classes, when each attitude component was analyzed on a deeper level, from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective, differences were found between the two classes for the components of Effort, Affect and Cognitive Competence, Interest, and Difficulty.},

@article{Auker2020,
abstract = {Abstract Learning ecology requires training in data management and analysis. Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor's degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. In this paper, we begin by presenting data from the last ten years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. We then discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field laboratory, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field laboratory, focused on analyzing existing datasets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following: Learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time commitment for course preparation; and there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how one's course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students? continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.},

abstract = {Web-augmented traditional lecture, fully online, and flipped sections, all taught by the same instructor with the same course schedule, assignments, and exams in the same semester, were compared with regards to student attitudes; statistical reasoning; performance on common exams, homework, and projects; and perceptions of the course and instructor. The Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics-36 (SATS-36) instrument and eight questions from the Statistical Reasoning Assessment (SRA) were given both at the beginning and end of the semester to measure change. The students selected their own sections, but the students in the sections were similar demographically, with similar pre-course college grade point averages. The SATS-36 showed increases in affect, cognitive competence, and perceived easiness and decreases in value, interest, and effort from beginning to end of the semester for all sections. Only affect and perceived easiness showed any differences for section, with traditional higher than online on average for both. Results from the SRA questions showed an increase in correct statistical reasoning skills and decrease in misconceptions for all sections over the semester. Traditional students scored higher on average on all three exams, but there were no significant differences between sections on homework, the project, or on university evaluations of the course or instructor. Results are contextualized with prior educational research on course modalities, and proposals for future research are provided.},

@article{Freeman2014,
abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6{\%} in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes - although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},
